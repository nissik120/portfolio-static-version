# Brief
I have created this website as a way of showcasing my skills as well as teaching others.
Read my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nissi.kazembe) that accompany this repository.
In the initial planning phase of this project the following goals were set:
* Implement a static website
* Implement with purely HTML, CSS and JS (no extra libraries that extend the capabilities)
* Progressively make changes over time within the constraits of the technologies listed above.
* Document the journey, highlight all the key points.

# Technologies
Teamwork makes the dream work.

The following tools contributed to the realization of the website as seen.
